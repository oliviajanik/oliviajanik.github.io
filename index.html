  <h3>About Olivia</h3>
  <p>I am a sophomore journalism student and history minor at the University of Maryland. My journalism background is in editing and sports writing. My history studies are concentrated in women's history and British history.
    <br>
  Originally from the Chicagoland area, I was drawn to Maryland because of their strong journalism school and their Big Ten membership. On campus, I'm involved with the independent student newspaper, the Diamondback, as a copy editor and sports writer. I currently cover Maryland women's lacrosse. Outside of journalism, I am involved in this university's choir program and the Hysterics, an all-female and non-binary comedy group.
  <br>
  After graduating, I hope to continue journalism by working in the sports journalism field. Currently, I am seeking journalism internships for Summer 2022
