    <h2>Early life and training</h2>
    <p>Sully was born in 2016; his moth was Roxanne.
        <br>
        Upon leaving his brood, he was trained by the charity America's VetDogs to perform a two-page list of commands,
        which includes fetching items, answering a telephone, and summoning help in an emergency. He was assigned to
        assist George H. W. Bush in the summer of 2018, through the dog's participation in a veteran service dog program
        at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. According to America's VetDogs, Sully was named after
        former U.S. Air Force officer and US Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger III. Sully received early attention from
        his own Instagram page covering his life and work wih the Bush family.

    <h2>Death of George H.W. Bush</h2>
    <p>Following the death of President Bush, Sully accompanied the 41st president's remains to Washington D.C. for the
        state funeral. A photo posted to Twitter by Bush spokesman Jim McGrath showing the dog sleeping next to the
        coffin containing Bush's remains in Texas attracted more than 230,000 likes in two days. Sully also visited the
        Capitol rotunda where Bush was lying in state. According to reports, he was to be returned to an America's
        VetDogs facility in New York during the Christmas season before being placed back into rotation in the service
        animal program at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.</p>
